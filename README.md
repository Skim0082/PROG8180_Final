  **User List Example**
  
    - I uploaded example files of User list.
    - It contains from AngularJS to access to the mySQL 'users' table.
    - It contains the source codes for CRUD functions
    - I hope these files would be helpful to start our project.
    - Before using them, several node packages are necessary to install
      -- Node v4.2.2 (https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.2/node-v4.2.2-x64.msi)
      -- Express (npm install express --save)
      -- mySql (npm install mysql --save)
      -- body-parser (npm install body-parser --save)
    - In my opinion, please review these example codes to catch up with the usage with AngularJS, NodeJS, and mySQL.
    - I'm willing to help you how these work.
    - Then as soon as possible, we should discuss further steps together.
